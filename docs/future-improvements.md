# Future Improvements

This document outlines areas for potential growth and refinement in the system, focusing on scalability, maintainability, security, and developer efficiency.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- Add GitHub Actions for automated tests on PRs, linting and build validation
- ADD IaC with CDK for automatic deploys
- Version infrastructure alongside application code
- Environment-based deployment (dev/stage/prod)

## Testing

- Increase unit test coverage
- Create contract tests between services and upstream dependencies
- Add e2e tests simulating API usage

## Security & Compliance

- Implement request validation, rate limiting, and secure headers
- Implement Authentication and Authorization
- Enforce least-privilege IAM policies
- Use row-level security
- Encrypt data

## Observability & Monitoring

- Add structured logging
- Integrate with logging/monitoring tool
- Set up alerting and SLO dashboards (latency, error rate, throughput)

## Performance & Scalability

- Profile API performance under load
- Tune Lambdas and DB queries
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Add read replicas

## Reliability & Fault Tolerance

- Introduce retry strategies and exponential backoff for upstream calls
- Use DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) for failed events
- Graceful degradation in case of partial outages
- Use Circuit Breaker Patterns
- Enable automatic backups

## Cost Optimization

- Use AWS cost explorer or other tools to monitor usage
